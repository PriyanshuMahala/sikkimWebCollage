    The east district is the most populated with Gangtok being the main administrative and business centre.
    Apart from the modern attractions of the capital town, in the east you will also find the beautiful Tsomgo 
    Lake, the historically important Nathula pass, as well as many monasteries and temples. Gangtok is the
    capital of Sikkim and heart of all the business hubs.

    West Sikkim is replete with history and religion. 
    This is where the first Chogyal of Sikkim was consecrated at Yuksum in 1642 and this is where some 
    of the holiest and most important monasteries of Sikkim were established, including Dubdi and Sanga 
    Choling, the first monasteries to be built in Sikkim. West Sikkim is beautiful terrain abounding in 
    lakes and waterfalls and also has great trekking routes. Gyalshing is the head quarter and town of 
    the West District.
